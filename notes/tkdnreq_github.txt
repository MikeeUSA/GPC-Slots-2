(After a "John Doe" who's license was revoked made a false "MikeeUSA" account on github
and then uploaded the work, modified it, etc.)
(As you know, in the USA; a license, absent an attached interest, is revokable.
The "John Doe" did not pay me (MikeeUSA), the copyright owner of the GPC-Slots2 game code
[note: I make no claim to PERL, nor the color ansi lib, nor the -2 split screen code]
and the original author of the work (me: MikeeUSA), anything, we are not in privity of contract
with eachother. Thus he has no attached interest. Thus his license is revokable at my pleasure.
Such was, indeed, my pleasure.)

DMCA takedown notice-GPCSlots2

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

GPC-Slots 2 is a text-mode casino game I created. It includes 5 slot machines, 3 table games (Sic Bo, Craps, and 2 variations of the little wheel), plus Russian Roulette and a stock market.
You can enjoy it from here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/gpcslots2/

*What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository's URL:**

http://github.com/MikeeUSA/GPC-Slots-2

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes, they are also on other platforms, all uploaded by the "John Doe"

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

Yes. The GPL. However I had revoked the "John Doe"'s license. The license, in this instance, being a bare license.
A license without an interest attached is revocable, in the USA.
The "John Doe" was not in privity of contract with me, and had not paid me anything for the work.
It was licensed to him under a bare license, which had then been rescinded.
He thus had not, and does not have, any permission to use, modify, distribute, nor make derivative works of the aforementioned work.
Remeber: the license comes from me, the Copyright owner. Not from any document or record: that is simply a memorandum of the terms.
I have chosen to revoke the "John Doe"'s license, and not issue any to him further. He has been informed of this.
His actions there-after and at current are infringing.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**

The only solution that I will accept is you acquiescing to my demand of removal.

**Do you have the alleged infringer's contact information? If so, please provide it:**

No. You can ask him for it here: 8ch.net/tech/res/1018729.html
You can also contact the "John Doe" through the email he registered with you. Don't play dumb.

**Please confirm that you have you have read our Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice: https://help.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/**

I really do not give half a damn about your guide. It is patronizing and moronic, it sounds as if it were written by a woman, perhaps a paralegal.
The fact of the matter is that a bare license is revocable by the grantor.
To achieve an irrevocable license one must generally enter into a copyright license contract with the licensor, supported by good consideration.
"Obeying the license" is not good consideration as it is a pre-existing legal duty.
